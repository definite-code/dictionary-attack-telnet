It asks IP address and port to which it will perform dictionary telnet attack.

I have hosted my telnet server on IP: 34.204.31.88
				port : 2323

this program can be used to perform dictionary attack on above server.
Since, the setting are set to accept any credentials on above server, the attack will be successful in the first try itself.
